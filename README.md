# AI-Smile

A web application for tracking and analyzing the impact of medications on multiple sclerosis (MS) progression. This personal project enables systematic documentation of medications, symptoms, side effects, and health parameters, then uses artificial intelligence to analyze correlations between therapy and patient health status.

## Project Description

AI-Smile is a comprehensive health tracking application designed for managing multiple sclerosis treatment. The application allows users to:

- **Manage Medications**: Add, edit, and track all medications with active substance dosages
- **Daily Reports**: Document daily health status including symptoms, side effects, mood, weight, and blood pressure
- **AI Analysis**: Generate intelligent insights using GPT-4/GPT-4o or Claude 3.5 Sonnet to identify correlations between medications and symptoms
- **Visualizations**: View interactive charts tracking weight and blood pressure trends over time
- **Timeline View**: Browse historical reports in chronological order

This is a single-user application built as a personal/academic project without commercial aspirations, intended for local use.

## Getting Started Locally

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: v22.14.0 (specified in `.nvmrc`)
- **npm** or **yarn** package manager
- **Supabase account** and project
- **OpenRouter.ai API key** (or direct OpenAI/Anthropic API keys)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AI-Smile.git
   cd AI-Smile
   ```

2. **Install Node.js version**
   ```bash
   # If using nvm
   nvm install
   nvm use
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Environment Setup**
   
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:
   ```env
   # Supabase Configuration
   PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
   PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
   
   # AI API Configuration
   OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key
   # OR direct API keys:
   # OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   # ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key
   
   # User ID (MVP uses hard-coded user)
   USER_ID=your_user_uuid
   ```

5. **Database Setup**
   
   Set up your Supabase database with the required tables:
   - `users`
   - `medications`
   - `daily_reports`
   - `ai_analyses`
   
   *(Database schema documentation to be added)*

6. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The application will be available at `http://localhost:4321`
